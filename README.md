ireactorOS
==========

ireactor and superecmascript based full os

#Goals
## Integrate low level win32 and 
The virtualisation is slow and unreliable for desktop/laptop 
The reactos have done good job but it pay tribute to 
The wine project can run some but need to be more tightened to the core os.
The linux os and freebsd are (as a paradox)  rigid 

The win7 api is stable and nice. It will be not changed essential until 2020

There are some win32 app that can`t pe reliable run and there is no fully functional alternative under linux at this time

So do we need a fully functional independent Windows 7 Professional like system - until 2020, yes.

We need to look in the future for hardware changes - until 2020 - the next step will be miaturisation but there will be always 
As arm devices will have more processing power we can expect 
The next step in hardware will be thunderbolt and usb type C devices
The next step is to have new accelerated video boards and full hd games
The next step is have low ssd prices

The next 8k video is near but who need it right now when we don`t have yet fully adopted 4k ?



Chromeos and android os will be merged and also will be merged some portion of firefox os based on his performance (also some firefox os code need to be added here :) Think of nexus usb video, usb thetering and other nice functions android have on it and we love to have them into a desktop computer ! (adb for example ? )

There are also plenty of old devices that need to be able to be run under modern or old hardware - like handheld scanners, pos terminals over serial interfaces, POS devices, etc.

But most of the drivers are already here in the wild !!!!

All you have to do is put it together, even if devos.org told us it is not a good thing to do so.

For the common sense, increased security and independence, we need to run all this under a new flexible, open system

#Js as a language for everything
Ok, not js, better to think at a js-like language.
Js have some little limitations, most of them in ecma or js itself licence.
Some years ago this limits blocked us to use llvm in order to compile js to native code.

We need js as a target language as it is native understood by the browser. In many ways, a browser is just a windows manager and (gnome for example ) already are there implementations of the concepts you can start based on that ideea. It is enough to have something like (near dead) Adobe Flex/Air, windows rt, or lets`s say Titanium for mobile in order to build modern interfaces (modern as in atractive design for UI ) using html to describe the ui hierarchy, js for coding and css for describing the look and feel

The way is already open, and there is no reason not to do it.
