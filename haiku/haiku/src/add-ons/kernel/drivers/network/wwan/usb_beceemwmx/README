This driver requires a Beceem firmware/vendor configuration

The firmware is binary code pushed to the device and is 
a requirement to operate.

The vendor config is a binary configuration file provided
by the device vendor (Ubee, ZTE, Sierra,etc) to tell the
device about it's internal configuration.

Obtaining the Firmware / Vendor configuration
=========================================================
The driver will gracefully search the following directory
for it's needed binary files:
/boot/system/data/firmware/macxvi200/

macxvi200.bin
macvi.cfg

These needed files can be obtained by installing the vendor
provided drivers onto a windows system and checking in
system32/drivers

*Warning*
The license of the binary files is currently unknown.
