config VBOOT_STARTS_IN_BOOTBLOCK
	bool "Vboot starts verifying in bootblock"
	default n
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  Firmware verification happens during or at the end of bootblock.

config VBOOT_STARTS_IN_ROMSTAGE
	bool "Vboot starts verifying in romstage"
	default n
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE && !VBOOT_STARTS_IN_BOOTBLOCK
	help
	  Firmware verification happens during or at the end of romstage.

config VBOOT2_MOCK_SECDATA
	bool "Mock secdata for firmware verification"
	default n
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  Enabling VBOOT2_MOCK_SECDATA will mock secdata for the firmware
	  verification to avoid access to a secdata storage (typically TPM).
	  All operations for a secdata storage will be successful. This option
	  can be used during development when a TPM is not present or broken.
	  THIS SHOULD NOT BE LEFT ON FOR PRODUCTION DEVICES.

config VBOOT_DISABLE_DEV_ON_RECOVERY
	bool "Disable dev mode on recovery requests"
	default n
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  When this option is enabled, the Chrome OS device leaves the
	  developer mode as soon as recovery request is detected. This is
	  handy on embedded devices with limited input capabilities.

config SEPARATE_VERSTAGE
	bool "Vboot verification is built into a separate stage"
	default n
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE

config RETURN_FROM_VERSTAGE
	bool "The separate verification stage returns to its caller"
	default n
	depends on SEPARATE_VERSTAGE
	help
	  If this is set, the verstage returns back to the calling stage instead
	  of exiting to the succeeding stage so that the verstage space can be
	  reused by the succeeding stage. This is useful if a ram space is too
	  small to fit both the verstage and the succeeding stage.

config CHIPSET_PROVIDES_VERSTAGE_MAIN_SYMBOL
	bool "The chipset provides the main() entry point for verstage"
	default n
	depends on SEPARATE_VERSTAGE
	help
	  The chipset code provides their own main() entry point.

config VBOOT_DYNAMIC_WORK_BUFFER
	bool "Vboot's work buffer is dynamically allocated."
	default y if ARCH_ROMSTAGE_X86_32 && !SEPARATE_VERSTAGE
	default n
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  This option is used when there isn't enough pre-main memory
	  ram to allocate the vboot work buffer. That means vboot verification
	  is after memory init and requires main memory to back the work
	  buffer.
