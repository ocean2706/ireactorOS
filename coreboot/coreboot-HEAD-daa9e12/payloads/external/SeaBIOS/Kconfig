	  Some PS/2 keyboard controllers don't respond to commands immediately
	  after powering on. This specifies how long SeaBIOS will wait for the
	  keyboard controller to become ready before giving up.

	prompt "Hardware init during option ROM execution"
	default n
	bool
	help
	  Allow hardware init to run in parallel with optionrom execution.

	  This can reduce boot time, but can cause some timing
	  variations during option ROM code execution. It is not
	  known if all option ROMs will behave properly with this option.

	  Coreboot can initialize the GPU of some mainboards.

	  After initializing the GPU, the information about it can be passed to the payload.
	  Provide an option rom that implements this legacy VGA BIOS compatibility requirement.

	  This option allows a platform to set Kconfig options for a basic
