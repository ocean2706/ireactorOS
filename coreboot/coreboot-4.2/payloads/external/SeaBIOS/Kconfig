config SEABIOS_PS2_TIMEOUT
	prompt "PS/2 keyboard controller initialization timeout (milliseconds)"
	default 0
	int
	help
	  Some PS/2 keyboard controllers don't respond to commands immediately
	  after powering on. This specifies how long SeaBIOS will wait for the
	  keyboard controller to become ready before giving up.

config SEABIOS_THREAD_OPTIONROMS
	prompt "Hardware init during option ROM execution"
	default n
	bool
	help
	  Allow hardware init to run in parallel with optionrom execution.

	  This can reduce boot time, but can cause some timing
	  variations during option ROM code execution. It is not
	  known if all option ROMs will behave properly with this option.

config SEABIOS_MALLOC_UPPERMEMORY
	bool
	default y
	help
	  Use the "Upper Memory Block" area (0xc0000-0xf0000) for internal
	  "low memory" allocations.  If this is not selected, the memory is
	  instead allocated from the "9-segment" (0x90000-0xa0000).
	  This is not typically needed, but may be required on some platforms
	  to allow USB and SATA buffers to be written correctly by the
	  hardware.  In general, if this is desired, the option will be
	  set to 'N' by the chipset Kconfig.

config SEABIOS_VGA_COREBOOT
	prompt "Include generated option rom that implements legacy VGA BIOS compatibility"
	default n
	depends on !VGA_BIOS && (MAINBOARD_DO_NATIVE_VGA_INIT || MAINBOARD_HAS_NATIVE_VGA_INIT_TEXTMODECFG)
	bool
	help
	  Coreboot can initialize the GPU of some mainboards.
	  
	  After initializing the GPU, the information about it can be passed to the payload.
	  Provide an option rom that implements this legacy VGA BIOS compatibility requirement.
